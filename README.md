### Visualization Notes

I switched the visual display of magnitude and depth, compared to what it says in the homework instructions.
A large green dot looks much less dangerous than a small red dot, so making magnitude relate to color portrays the intensity of the earthquake more clearly. (Based on my limited understanding that magnitude is more telling of the intensity than depth.)



### Things to Change

The legend is functional but I don't like how it looks, or that the ranges are in descending order rather than ascending.
